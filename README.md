# osu-cli

A simple CLI tool for checking your osu! stats â€” intended as a lightweight alternative to Discord bots like BathBot or owo!bot.

Currently, `osu-cli` only retrieves your most recent submitted score (similar to the `/rs` command in BathBot).

## To-do

- Add support for PP info:
  - PP for SS
  - PP if FC
  - PP on failed scores
- Generate an image showing your most recent score
- Publish as an AUR package
- Set up CI/CD (possibly via a custom repo for pacman, APT, and DNF)
- Add more features based on user feedback
